## Get Started

install dev dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Then

go to https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb, create an account and get the api key, then use that api key in constants/index.js file

## Then

Run The app

```
npm start
```

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

```
npm run ios
```

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

```
npm run android
```

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
